# Image-Classification

Built a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can classify images of three different hand gestures representing rock, paper and scissors. 
It has accuracy of 76%

# Dataset

Used tensorflow datatset of rock,paper,scissors.

# Model Architecture 

Built a sequential CNN model to perform the image classification. 
The model contains several convolutional layers to extract featured from images which is later followed by max-pooling to reduce spacial dimensions. 
Dropout Layer is added to reduce overfitting.
